- 👋 Hi, I’m @ADR3-N
- 👀 I’m interested in AI Voice replacement and models, browser extensions, and audio processing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use so-vits-svc, and I'm okay at it, but I could use a little hand here and there
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ANYTHING related to so-vits-svc, be it grabbing source material or assisting to process existing material
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm very easy to find on Twitter @ OGAdrean. I check daily!
